This library offers a BLE API for the Viron and Halo series of AstralPool chlorinators and can be used to remote control pool pump and the chlorinator operation.

It is the foundation for the HomeAssistant [Astral Pool Viron eQuilibrium Chlorinator](https://github.com/pbutterworth/astralpool_chlorinator) plugin.
